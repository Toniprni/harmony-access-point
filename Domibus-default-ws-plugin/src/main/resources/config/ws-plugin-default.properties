#The notifications sent by Domibus to the plugin. The following values are possible: MESSAGE_RECEIVED,MESSAGE_FRAGMENT_RECEIVED,MESSAGE_SEND_FAILURE,MESSAGE_FRAGMENT_SEND_FAILURE,MESSAGE_RECEIVED_FAILURE,MESSAGE_FRAGMENT_RECEIVED_FAILURE,MESSAGE_SEND_SUCCESS,MESSAGE_FRAGMENT_SEND_SUCCESS,MESSAGE_STATUS_CHANGE,MESSAGE_FRAGMENT_STATUS_CHANGE

#Timeout values for communication between the ws plugin and the backend service
#ConnectionTimeOut - Specifies the amount of time, in milliseconds, that the consumer will attempt to establish a connection before it times out. 0 is infinite.

#Allows chunking when sending messages to the backend service
